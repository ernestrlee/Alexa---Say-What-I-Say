# Alexa - Say What I Say

## What the skill does
Say What I Say is an Amazon Alexa Skill that you can use on any Amazon Alexa enabled device, such as an Echo or Dot. With this skill, you can tell Alexa to repeat anything you want her to say.  

After she says your phrase, you can have her repeat the phrase as normal, or in other different voice modes.  There are voice modes such as talking faster or slower, higher or lower, backwards or in reverse, and even as a robot.  Each mode may use a different combination of word or letter rearrangement as well as Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), which causes Alexa to change the way she talks.
