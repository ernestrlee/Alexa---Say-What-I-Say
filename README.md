# Alexa - Say What I Say

## What the skill does
Say What I Say is an Amazon Alexa Skill that you can use on any Amazon Alexa enabled device, such as an Echo or Dot. This skill will allow Alexa to repeat the things you say with a choice of 20 different voices and more than 10 different voice modes! You can change Alexa's accent and have her talk like a British Male! You can also have Alexa talk fast, slow, with a high voice, or a low voice, backwards, in reverse, whispering, in a drunk voice, as a robot, spelling out words, and saying words with random beeps!

This is all possible by utilizing Amazon's SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language).
